To solve this problem, you can simulate the shifts by keeping track of the total shift amount. Since the string length can be large, it's better to perform the shifts modulo the length of the string to avoid unnecessary rotations.

Here's a Python function to implement this:

```python
def string_shift(s, shifts):
    total_shift = 0
    for direction, amount in shifts:
        if direction == 0:  # Left shift
            total_shift -= amount
        else:  # Right shift
            total_shift += amount
    
    # Perform shifts modulo the length of the string
    total_shift %= len(s)
    
    # Shift the string accordingly
    return s[-total_shift:] + s[:-total_shift]
```

This function should handle the given examples and constraints.
