To solve this problem, you can iterate through the array and use a set to keep track of unique elements. For each element x, check if x + 1 is also in the set. If it is, increment the count. Finally, return the count. Here's a Python function to implement this:

```python
def count_elements(arr):
    count = 0
    unique_elements = set(arr)
    
    for x in arr:
        if x + 1 in unique_elements:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

This function should work for the given examples and constraints.
