To find the maximum difference between two integers obtained by applying the given operations to a given integer, you can try all possible pairs of digits x and y and calculate the resulting integers. Then, you can find the maximum difference between these two integers.

Here's a Python function to implement this:

```python
def max_diff(num: int) -> int:
    num_str = str(num)
    max_diff = 0
    
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            a = int(num_str.replace(str(i), str(j)))
            if a != 0 and str(a)[0] != '0':
                for k in range(10):
                    for l in range(10):
                        b = int(str(a).replace(str(k), str(l)))
                        if b != 0 and str(b)[0] != '0':
                            max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(a - b))
    
    return max_diff

# Example usage:
# num = 555
# print(max_diff(num))  # Output: 888
```

This function returns the maximum difference between two integers obtained by applying the given operations to the input integer.
