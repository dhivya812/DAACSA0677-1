To solve this problem, you need to find the kid with the maximum number of candies without the extra candies. Then, for each kid, check if giving them the extra candies would make their total number of candies greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies found earlier.

Here's a Python function to implement this:

```python
def kids_with_candies(candies, extraCandies):
    max_candies = max(candies)
    result = []
    
    for candy in candies:
        if candy + extraCandies >= max_candies:
            result.append(True)
        else:
            result.append(False)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3]
# extraCandies = 3
# print(kids_with_candies(candies, extraCandies))  # Output: [True, True, True, False, True]
```

This function returns a boolean array where each element indicates whether giving the corresponding kid all the extra candies would make them have the greatest number of candies among all the kids.
