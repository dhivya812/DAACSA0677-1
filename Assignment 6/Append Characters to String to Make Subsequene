To determine the minimum number of characters needed to be appended to the end of string \( s \) so that string \( t \) becomes a subsequence of \( s \), you can iterate through the characters of \( t \) and check if each character exists in \( s \). If a character in \( t \) doesn't exist in \( s \), it needs to be appended to \( s \) to make \( t \) a subsequence.

Here's a Python function to implement this:

```python
def min_chars_to_append(s, t):
    s_pointer = 0
    t_pointer = 0
    min_chars = 0
    
    while t_pointer < len(t):
        if s_pointer >= len(s):
            min_chars += len(t) - t_pointer
            break
        
        if s[s_pointer] == t[t_pointer]:
            t_pointer += 1
        
        s_pointer += 1
    
    return min_chars

# Example usage:
s1 = "coaching"
t1 = "coding"
print(min_chars_to_append(s1, t1))  # Output: 4

s2 = "abcde"
t2 = "a"
print(min_chars_to_append(s2, t2))  # Output: 0

s3 = "z"
t3 = "abcde"
print(min_chars_to_append(s3, t3))  # Output: 5
```

This function iterates through the characters of both strings, \( s \) and \( t \), using two pointers. It counts the characters needed to be appended to \( s \) so that \( t \) becomes a subsequence of \( s \).
