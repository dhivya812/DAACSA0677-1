Here's the SQL query to find all pairs of elements that can form a bond:

```sql
SELECT m.symbol AS metal, n.symbol AS nonmetal
FROM Elements m
JOIN Elements n
ON m.type = 'Metal' AND n.type = 'Nonmetal'
WHERE m.electrons >= n.electrons;
```

This query selects pairs of elements where one is a metal (`type = 'Metal'`) and the other is a nonmetal (`type = 'Nonmetal'`). It also ensures that the number of electrons the metal can give is greater than or equal to the number of electrons the nonmetal needs.
